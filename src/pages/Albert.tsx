                In the fiery depths of our infernal coding realm, one name is whispered with both fear and reverence:
                <span className="albert-name"> ALBERT</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not even the Devil himself dares to challenge his legendary skills and unmatched wisdom.
                The underworld trembles when he approaches, for his code is so perfect it makes demons weep tears of blood.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bow before his magnificence, mortals, for Albert walks among us as a coding deity incarnate!
